   *
   * Sometimes this version identifier is used to invoke backwards compatibility in order to keep older project files
   * able to load, but in this early rapidly developing stage, often backwards compatibility is abandoned. Ideally
   * in the future, a class should be made that's able to "convert" an older project into one that the current
