/**
 * @brief The Cacher class
 *
 * For footage clips - usually the majority of clips - decoding can be strenuous on CPU and inconsistent in timing. As
 * a result, we keep a memory cache of upcoming frames that we fill in a background thread so they can be retrieved from
 * a rendering thread later. This class is the background thread filling up a clip's frame cache (also called a "queue"
 * since video files are usually stored with frames in linear chronological order). It involves decoding routines to
 * retrieve raw frames from the file (using libavformat/libavcodec), conversion routines to conform the raw frames to
 * RGBA/S16LE for the rest of the workflow (using libavfilter/libswscale/libswresample), and memory handling routines
 * for keeping the cache within limits defined by the user (see Config::upcoming_queue_type).
 *
 * Generally the Cacher workflow starts by calling Open() which will start the thread, open a file handle, and create a
 * decoding instance. Open() is usually called directly from the parent Clip's Clip::Open() and thus expects the
 * Clip::state_change_lock to be locked. It will unlock it when it's finished opening and is ready to start caching,
 * meaning Clip::state_change_lock can be used to synchronize threads.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * **For video:**
 *
 * After the Cacher has finished opening, request a frame by calling Cache(). Cache() will tell the Cacher
 * information about the current playback state, most importantly the current place in time according to the Sequence's
 * playhead. Cache() determines whether the requested frame is already in the queue, and then signals the Cacher thread
 * to cache ahead if there's room in the queue (and also remove old frames that are no longer necessary). To retrieve
 * the requested frame, call Retrieve().
 *
 * If Cache() found the frame already in the queue, Retrieve() will return immediately with this frame. Otherwise
 * Retrieve() may block while the cacher retrieves it. Therefore it is recommended never to call Retrieve() from
 * the main thread. Retrieve() may also return `nullptr` if there was an issue, e.g. the cacher failed to retrieve
 * the frame.
 *
 * **For audio:**
 *
 * After the Cacher has finished opening, calling Cache() will handle most of the work. It will decode the audio,
 * convert to the correct sample rate and format, reverse or adjust speed if necessary, and send it to the audio
 * buffer ready to be played by the output device. It is important to continually call Cache() as it doesn't get
 * signalled when more samples are available in the audio buffer. Instead, it'll check every time it's called and
 * fill as much of the buffer as it can.
 *
 * If the user seeks, ResetAudio() must be called to signal the Cacher to interrupt the current audio stream and
 * move somewhere else before continuing.
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Finally, when the Cacher/parent Clip are no longer in use, call Close() to free all memory and file handling
 * allocated for the cacher. You can choose whether to wait for Close() and all of its child processes to complete -
 * e.g. if you need to change something with the Clip or attached Footage that changes how it opens and want to be
 * thread-safe - or let the Close thread finish up on its own.
 *
 * Cacher expects to be multithreaded and all of its public functions are thread-safe.

   * @brief Request a frame to be cached
   *
   * For video, this function is part 1 of the Cache()/Retrieve() workflow. It signals the thread to start caching and
   * provides a few other details about the playback state. For optimization it'll also check the frame queue if it
   * already contains the requested frame and use it if so, potentially speeding up Retrieve() later on. Otherwise
   * it'll interrupt any currently caching operation and signal it to start again.
   * While Retrieve() will block until the correct frame is retrieved, this function will return fairly quickly (either
   * immediately if the frame was found in the queue, or once the cacher has restarted caching if not). This means
   * Cache() can be called from another thread and then that other thread can do other work while the cacher is
   * retrieving the frame, finally calling Retrieve() once the frame is absolutely necessary.
   *
   * For audio, this function will do all the work of signalling the thread to start caching and sending samples to
   * the output audio buffer. It's used in tandem with ResetAudio() when the Timeline header is changed abruptly.
