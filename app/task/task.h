/**
 * @brief A base class for background tasks running in Olive.
 *
 * Tasks are multithreaded by design (i.e. they will always spawn
 * a new thread and run in it).
 *
 * To subclass your own Task, override Action() and return TRUE on success or FALSE on failure. Note that a Task can
 * provide a "negative" output and still have succeeded. For example, the ProbeTask's role is to determine whether a
 * certain media file can be used in Olive. Even if the probe *fails* to find a Decoder for this file, the Task itself
 * has *succeeded* at discovering this. A failure of ProbeTask would indicate a catastrophic failure meaning it was
 * unable to determine anything about the file.
 *
 * Tasks should be used with the TaskManager which will manage starting and deleting them. It'll also only start as
 * many Tasks as there are threads on the system as to not overload them.
 *
 * Tasks support "dependency tasks", i.e. a Task that should be complete before another Task begins.
