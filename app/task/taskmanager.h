 * @brief An object that manages background Task objects, handling their start and end

 * AddTask(). TaskManager will take ownership of the task and add it to a queue until it system resources are available
 * for it to run. Currently, TaskManager will run no more Tasks than there are threads on the system (one task per
 * thread). As Tasks finished, TaskManager will start the next in the queue.
