/**
 * @brief A dialog for editing Sequence parameters
 *
 * This dialog exposes all the parameters of a Sequence to users allowing them to set up a Sequence however they wish.
 * A Sequence can be sent to this dialog through the constructor. All fields will be filled using that Sequence's
 * parameters, allowing the user to view and edit them. Accepting the dialog will apply them back to that Sequence,
 * either directly or using an UndoCommand (see SetUndoable()).
 *
 * If creating a new Sequence, the Sequence must still be constructed first before sending it to SequenceDialog.
 * SequenceDialog does not create any new objects. In most cases when creating a new Sequence, editing its parameters
 * with SequenceDialog will be paired with the action of adding the Sequence to a project. In this situation, since the
 * latter will be the main undoable action, the parameter editing doesn't have to be undoable since to the user they'll
 * be viewed as one single action (see SetUndoable()).
