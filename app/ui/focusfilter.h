 * @brief The FocusFilter class
 *
 * Some keyboard shortcuts/menu actions will do different things depending on the panel that's currently focused.
 * For example, pressing "Set Marker" will set a marker on the main active sequence if the timeline is focused,
 * or on the media in the Media Viewer if the Media Viewer is focused. This class provides slots/functions that
 * can be called that will check which panel is focused and call the appropriate function.
 *
 * Responds to `config.hover_focus`. Default behavior is focus by clicking on the panels, but if `hover_focus` is
 * **TRUE**, the focused panel will be whichever panel has the cursor currently hovering over it.
