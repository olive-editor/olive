/**
 * @brief Create an icon object loaded from file
 *
 * Using `name`, this function will load icon files to create an icon object that can be used throughout the
 * application.
 *
 * Olive's icons are stored in a very specific format. They are all sourced from SVGs, but stored as PNGs of various
 * sizes. See `app/ui/icons/genicons.sh`, as this script not only generates the multiple sizes but also the QRC file
 * used to compile the icons into the executable.
 *
 * This function is heavily tied into `genicons.sh` and will load all the different sized images (using the same
 * filename formatting and QRC resource directory) that `genicons.sh` generates into one QIcon file. If you change
 * either this function or `genicons.sh`, you will very likely have to change the other too.
 *
 * There is not much reason to call this outside of LoadAll() (which stores icons globally in memory so they don't
 * have to be reloaded each time a new object needs an icon).
 *
 * @param theme
 *
 * Name of the theme (used in the URL as the folder to load PNGs from)
 *
 * @param name
 *
 * Name of the icon (will correspond to the original SVG's filename with no path or extension)
 *
 * @return
 *
 * A QIcon object containing the various icon sizes loaded from resource
