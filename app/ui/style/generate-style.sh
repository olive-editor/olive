# A simple script that uses Inkscape to generate multiple PNG sizes from SVGs.
# It also generates a Qt resource file including all of them for usage in
# Olive.
#
# While Qt (and therefore Olive) can load SVG files into icons during runtime,
# this is slow and lags startup. This script is intended to mitigate that, and
# while it adds an extra step if an SVG is modified, it immensely benefits
# the end user.
