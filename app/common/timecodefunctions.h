 * @brief Functions for converting times/timecodes/timestamps

 *
 * `time` - time in seconds presented in a rational form
 * `timebase` - the base time unit of an audio/video stream in seconds
 * `timestamp` - an integer representation of a time in timebase units (in many cases is used like a frame number)
 * `timecode` a user-friendly string representation of a time according to Timecode::Display
