/**
 * @brief A fully integrated system of storing and playing cached audio
 *
 * All audio in Olive is processed and rendered in advance. This makes playback extremely smooth
 * and reliable, but provides some challenges as far as storing and manipulating this audio while
 * minimizing the amount of re-renders necessary.
 *
 * Olive's PlaybackCaches support "shifting"; moving cached data to a different spot on the
 * timeline without requiring a costly re-render. While video is naturally stored on disk as
 * separate frames that are easy to swap out, audio works a little differently. It would be
 * extremely inefficient to store each sample as a separate file on the disk, but storing in
 * one single contiguous file would be detrimental to shifting, particularly for longer timelines
 * since the data will actually have to be shifted on disk.
 *
 * As such, AudioPlaybackCache compromises by storing audio in several "segments". This makes
 * operations like shifting much easier since segments can simply be removed from the playlist
 * rather than having to shift or re-render potentially hours of audio in every operation.
 *
 * Naturally, storing in segments means you can't simply play the PCM data like a file, so
 * AudioPlaybackCache also provides a playback device (accessible from CreatePlaybackDevice()) that
 * acts identically to a file-based IO device, transparently joining segments together and acting
 * like one contiguous file.
