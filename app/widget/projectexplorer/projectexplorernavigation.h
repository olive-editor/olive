/**
 * @brief A navigation bar widget for ProjectExplorer's Icon and List views
 *
 * Unlike the Tree view, Icon and List don't follow a hierarchical view of information. This means there is no direct
 * way of navigating in and out of folders in those view types. We solve this in two ways:
 *
 * * Double clicking a Folder in those views will enter that folder
 * * This navigation bar offers a "directory up" button for leaving a folder
 *
 * This navbar also provides an icon size slider for those views (between kProjectIconSizeMinimum and
 * kProjectIconSizeMaximum) as well as text that's intended to be set to the current Folder's name (or
 * empty for the root folder).
 *
 * This widget does not actually communicate to Project or ProjectExplorer classes. It is simply UI widgets that are
 * intended to be connected in ways that do. This is the primarily responsibility of ProjectExplorer.
 *
 * By default, the directory up button is disabled (assuming root folder), the text is empty, and the icon size slider
 * is set to kProjectIconSizeDefault.
