/**
 * @brief A menu widget for context menus and menu bars
 *
 * A QMenu subclass with functions for creating menus and menu items that conform to Olive's menu and keyboard shortcut
 * system.
 *
 * In Olive, menu items in the menu bar are also responsible for keyboard shortcuts throughout the application. To allow
 * these to be configurable and these configurations saveable, every item needs a unique ID. This ID gets linked to the
 * keyboard shortcuts in config files. The ID doesn't get translated so it can also persist through language changes.
 *
 * The ID gets stored in the QAction's "id" property. If a keyboard shortcut is provided, it gets stored in the
 * QAction's "keydefault" property.
 *
 * It is always recommended to use this over QMenu in any situation.
