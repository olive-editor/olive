Versions
========

.. note::
   Olive is in a very early development stage and considered alpha software.
   This means it is unstable, very likely to crash, it has bugs and misses
   features. The Olive team offers no warranty, so use it at your own risk.

* Olive 0.1.x is a somewhat useable alpha version, which is currently the
  recommended version to try out Olive. However, it does not receive bug fixes
  or enhancements anymore.

* Olive 0.2.x is an almost complete rewrite of the core (work in progress).
  The most notable changes are:

  * Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based architecture
  * Color management
  * Render cache
