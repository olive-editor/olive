Can you make the user interface prettier?
   First and foremost, Olive is a tool that is supposed to get work done.

   on functionality, and secondly on efficiency. You are welcome to tinker with
   themes to adjust the look however.

Can you make Olive more like Vegas / Premiere / Resolve / KDenlive / <insert software name here>?
   No, it has its own design goals and process. Imitating other software only
